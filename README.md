# SqMod-Experiments

## Compatibility layer
SqMod is capable of loading scripts written for the Official Squirrel plugin. And for external plugins, such as MySQL, Confloader, yadda yadda... you can use SqMod's features to replicate functionality. 

The **Compatibility layer** subdirectory has all you need for such case.

## Discord bot
SqMod no longer supports external plugins, however you can use ZeroMQ for inter-process communication. 

The **Discord** subdirectory provides a template to get a discord bot running for your server with minimal effort.

## Pterodactyl
Want to run SqMod inside a Pterodactyl container? Build a docker image with the Dockerfile. An egg designed for official plugin should work here too, just change the container image.
